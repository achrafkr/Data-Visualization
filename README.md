## 1. About
In this repository you will find notebooks and scripts showing various visualization methods for different scenarios. The main of focus is on the pertinence of the method used i.e how much information can be showcased, rather than an extended analysis of the information provided. 

Notebooks and scripts are gathered in their respectives directories. This repository is mostly comprised of annotated notebooks with explanations for each method. Notebooks may be supplemented by Python scripts for instances where code automation is necessary and/or for visual purposes. 

Since data is collected from a variety of sources, some notebooks and scripts may require a specific folder for the data. In recognition of the work done by the community, and to facilitate access to the data for future efforts, all sources will be acknowledged and source links will be provided when possible. Note, however, that some datasets are processed using multiple data sources. In such cases, the sources shall be disclosed, with varying degrees of detail. Additionally, we reserve the right to disclose the processing code when relevant to the project. It will also be clarified if the used data was artificially produced.

## 2. Requirements
For the correct execution and reproducibility of the notebooks, we recommend the use of the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) distribution system.

System requirements are generally basic and in specific cases where GPUs are used, it may be possible to run the project code using either the CPU or on a cloud environment in case the CPU becomes insufficient.

The required libraries are listed at the beginning of each notebook. We also recommend installing the [`Tensorflow`](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/working-with-conda/applications/tensorflow/) library.
It is advisable to check for compatibility between certain versions of the libraries used in each project, with particular attention to `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` and `tensorflow`.

## 3. Status
  1. **Football_stats** notebook is 100% complete.
  2. **Feature_visualization** notebook is 70% complete: All coding elements are ready. Annotations are going underway.
  3. **Weather_analysis** notebook is 40% complete. More content and explanations are expected to come.
